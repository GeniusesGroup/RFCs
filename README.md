# Memar 
**Memar** is a computer software development **structure** document that gives you a [structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism) mental model to understand the development model. The implementation version of Memar is used as the software development **framework**.

It will provide ZeroOps(zero operations), edge computing, ... that let you develope both server and client applications in any programming language without need to think more about any fundamental requirements, Just develope business services and user interfaces, build apps as OS images or OS applications and easily just run first server node and let it distributes by many factors with inside logics not need external decision makers (automating software deployment) like Kubernetes(K8s) but with some improvements.

## Goals
- Provide complete framework to develope any purpose distributed application with **low||no code**.
- No(minimum) dependency on any other repositories.
- Compile an application as **Unikernel** instead of regular OSs or containers binaries.
- Develope high available and distributed software without any admin in any infrastructure layers (DevOps culture goal).
- Let service developers act Lean and Agile in their organization.
- [Reinvent the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel)

## Not Goals
- 

## How
We almost just carry many good stuff in computer science such as
- OOP
- SDK
- DDD
- UniKernel & ExoKernel
- Agile & DevOps & NoOps

## Transition period
Since the Memar introduces all tools needed in software development and operation as a programming language([Khayyam](./Khayyam.md)) and OS([PersiaOS](./PersiaOS.md)) and network protocols like [Chapar](./networking-osi_2-Chapar.md) or [GP](./networking-osi_3-Giti-Network.md), If any organization want to move to the Memar, we provide some exiting programming language implementation to smooth this period and use existing infrastructure like Golang and Linux and IP.

**But remember we don't suggest using this method in starting new projects.**

## Enterprise
Contact us by [this](mailto:ict@geniuses.group) or [this](mailto:omidhekayati@gmail.com) if you need enterprise support for developing high available and distributed software. See features available in enterprise package:
- Develope exclusive features in very short time

## Word
Memar is the Persian word means [architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect), That is a person who plans, designs and oversees the construction of buildings.[1] To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose.[2] Etymologically, the term architect derives from the Latin architectus,[3] which derives from the Greek[4] (arkhi-, chief + tekton, builder), i.e., chief builder.[5]


## RFCs - Request for Comments
The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the related libraries or programs, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction them is evolving in. All fundamental changes to any RFCs can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.
