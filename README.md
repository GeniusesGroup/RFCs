# RFCs - Request for Comments
The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the related libraries or programs, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction them is evolving in. All fundamental changes to any RFCs can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.
